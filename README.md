# Tap Reactor
## By Stuart McKay\

July 4th, 2019

This project was an attempt to use React to create a bar's tap room display. __It is still a work in progress.__ This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation and Setup 

* Clone to project
* Open up the project and build dependent packages with `$ npm i`
* Start up the localhost server with `$ npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:8000` with a web browser

# Bugs

There are currently no known bugs. The lack of interactivity or responsive elements is a feature, not a bug.
